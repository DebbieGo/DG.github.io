## **Supply Chain Optimization Through Predictive Analytics**
For my General Assembly (GA) Data Analytics Capstone, I analyzed the Maven Analytics shipping dataset to address a critical inefficiency at Candy Cache: 68% of orders shipping from suboptimal factories, wasting 7.5 million miles annually and costing $88K in lost profits and excess shipping.


Traditional rule-based analysis falls short in complex supply chains. I developed advanced machine learning on the shipping dataset, where my Random Forest model achieved **94.9% accuracy in predicting optimal factory assignments**â€”transforming reactive logistics into proactive decision-making.


The solution includes an **interactive decision-support tool that empowers logistics teams to simulate routing scenarios and quantify profit impacts** before committing resources, shifting operations from guesswork to precision planning. This demonstrates how data science tranforms traditional supply chain management into competitive advantage.
